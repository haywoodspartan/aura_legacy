Aura
==========
Aura is an open-source server emulator, written in C#.
It's solely being developed for educational purposes,
learning about programming, MMORPGs, maintaining huge projects,
working with other people, and improving knowledge.
It's not about playing a game, or competing with any services provided
by Nexon or its partners, and we don't endorse such actions.

Aura is completely free and licensed under the GNU GPL.
As such, every user is free to use Aura, and choose how to use it.

Legacy
---------
This version of Aura will slowly become obsolete with the release of the rewritten,
improved version. Development will continue there.
